Debugging QDMA Performance Issues
=================================

		The blog in the link below provides general guidelines for debugging QDMA performance issues. The guidelines provided here cover both QDMA Subsystem in CPM and PL PCIE. Some content might not be applicable to both types of IP. Users are advised to check the documentation of the corresponding IP cores if there is any confusion.
		Debugging QDMA performance related issues can be challenging because the performance depends on both Hardware and Software. In order to achieve high performance, designers need to make sure the best QDMA design practice has been followed and that the parameters in the driver and BIOS settings are correctly tuned.
		This blog goes through various aspects of the overall ecosystem of a QDMA design that could affect QDMA performance and how they should be tuned.
